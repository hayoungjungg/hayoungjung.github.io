I am a M.S. student in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Tanushree Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/). My research interest are NLP, AI Ethics, and Computational Social Science.

As a graduate student, I've been fortunate to conduct research with [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), and [Monojit Choudhury](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/monojit-choudhury/). Previously, I received undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Political Science from the University of Washington.

## research interests
Broadly, my research interests revolve around **advancing language technologies to better serve diverse populations**. Specifically:
- **AI Ethics:** Evaluating how NLP models and AI-powered services, such as search engines, can propagate harms and misinformation, particularly affecting marginalized populations.
- **Computational Social Science:** Leveraging NLP techniques in conjunction with social science theories for a deeper understanding of diverse populations, communities, and culture.
